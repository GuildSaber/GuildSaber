### Starting the Project with Aspire

GuildSaber uses .NET Aspire for orchestrating its microservices architecture.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kuurama/GuildSaber.git
   cd GuildSaber
   ```

2. **Run the Aspire application:**
   ```bash
   cd aspire/GuildSaber.AppHost
   dotnet run
   ```

This will start the following services:

- MariaDB (with phpMyAdmin)
- Redis (with Redis Commander)
- Database Migrator
- API Service
- Discord Bot

The Aspire dashboard will open automatically, showing the status of all services.
