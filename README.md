- API Documentation: OpenAPI/Scalar documentation available at the API URL

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) (recommended) or Visual Studio 2022+

### Configuration

Before running the project, you need to configure the following settings:

1. **API Settings** (`src/GuildSaber.Api/appsettings.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "AuthSettings": {
       "Jwt": {
         "Secret": "YourSecureJwtSecret"
       },
       "BeatLeader": {
         "ClientId": "YourBeatLeaderClientId",
         "ClientSecret": "YourBeatLeaderClientSecret"
       },
       "Discord": {
         "ClientId": "YourDiscordClientId",
         "ClientSecret": "YourDiscordClientSecret"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Discord Bot Settings** (`src/GuildSaber.DiscordBot/appsettings.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "DiscordBotOptions": {
       "Id": 123456789012345678,
       "Name": "GuildSaber Bot",
       "Status": "Managing guilds",
       "Token": "YourDiscordBotToken",
       "ManagerId": 123456789012345678,
       "GuildId": 123456789012345678
     }
   }
   ```

### Starting the Project with Aspire

GuildSaber uses .NET Aspire for orchestrating its microservices architecture.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kuurama/GuildSaber.git
   cd GuildSaber
   ```

2. **Run the Aspire application:**
   ```bash
   cd aspire/GuildSaber.AppHost
   dotnet run
   ```

This will start the following services:

- Postgre (with PgWeb)
- Redis (with Redis Commander)
- Database Migrator
- API Service
- Discord Bot

The Aspire dashboard will open automatically, showing the status of all services.

## üß© Project Structure

- `src/GuildSaber.Api` - Main API service
- `src/GuildSaber.Database` - Database models and contexts
- `src/GuildSaber.DiscordBot` - Discord bot integration
- `src/GuildSaber.Common` - Shared utilities and services
- `aspire/` - .NET Aspire project orchestration
- `tools/GuildSaber.Migrator` - Database migration tool

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Migrations (EFCore)

GuildSaber uses Entity Framework Core (EFCore) for database schema management. Migrations are organized in the
`Migrations` folder inside each context directory under `src/GuildSaber.Database/Contexts`.

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- [EFCore CLI tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet) (install with
  `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef` if not already installed)

### Generating a Migration

1. **Navigate to the database project:**
   ```bash
   cd src/GuildSaber.Database
   ```

2. **Add a migration for a specific context:**

   For example, to add a migration for the `ServerDbContext` (migrations will be placed in
   `Contexts/Server/Migrations`):

   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName> \
     --context GuildSaber.Database.Contexts.Server.ServerDbContext \
     --output-dir Contexts/Server/Migrations
   ```

   For the DiscordBot context (replace with the actual context class name if different):

   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName> \
     --context GuildSaber.Database.Contexts.DiscordBot.DiscordBotDbContext \
     --output-dir Contexts/DiscordBot/Migrations
   ```

   Replace `<MigrationName>` with a descriptive name for your migration.

3. The database migrations will be automatically applied by the `GuildSaber.Migrator` service when it starts.

### Notes

- Always ensure you are in the `src/GuildSaber.Database` directory when running EFCore commands.
- Each context should have its own migrations in its respective `Migrations` folder.
- If you add or modify models, generate a new migration as shown above.
- They should be applied automatically when the `GuildSaber.Migrator` service starts.
- Do **NOT** push migrations to the repositories unless they reflect changes in the production database schema. Until
  then, no migrations should be pushed to the repository.
